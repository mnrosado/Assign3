# Assign3
For this project, I decided to layer generated text and video affects over an image I took and photoshopped. The text stood out because it seemed very unrelated to the original text I cleaned and ran through the notebook and provided me with the starting point for the narrative. I took a lot of inspiration from old youtube and analogue horror based on dystopian societies and disasters and wanted this video to have an intense, eerie atmosphere.
